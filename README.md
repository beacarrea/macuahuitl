## Synopsis

*The "Macuahuiltl" Generative Art Toolbox* is a collection of personal `Python 3` scripts to
generate artworks or elements for artworks that can either be used directly or processed further
in common vector design software packages.

All scripts output `Scalable Vector Graphics` (SVG) image files directly which easily can be
loaded in common vector graphics application like `InkScape`, `Affinity Designer`, `Adobe
Illustrator`, and so on. A few of the scripts also can output a custom `JSON`-based format of
particle or shape descriptions which then can be further processed by related scripts or
imported into 3D graphic software packages like `Blender` or `CINEMA 4D` for rendering.

## The ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù and The ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Usually to automatize generation of shapes or pattern for vector illustrations ‚Äîwhich would
be *way too boring* to create manually in Affinity Designer‚Äî the scripts start out with a quick
visual idea and just a handful lines of quick code as proof of concept.

Once that's done crazy silliness starts by making every variable of the algorithm user-configurable
via a CLI interface. The result: the scripts explode in code size exponentially. Not that this
really makes a lot of sense or would revolutionize the world‚Ä¶ it's simply **fun stuff** done for
recreation. So here we are! üòÖ

Comitl concentrically arranges randomly sized arcs into a pretty disc shape. Output is generated as a set of vector shapes in Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) format and printed on the standard output stream. Comitl also supports SVG animations, optional PNG output
(with `cairosvg`), and has countless of parameters for configuration of the generated shape.
