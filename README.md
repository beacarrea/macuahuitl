## Synopsis

*The "Macuahuiltl" Generative Art Toolbox* is a collection of personal `Python 3` scripts to generate artworks or elements
for artworks that can either be used directly or processed further in common vector design software packages. All scripts
start out with a quick visual idea and just a handful lines of code as proof of concept. Once that's done usually some
crazy silliness starts by making every variable of the algorithm easily user-configurable via a CLI interface. The scripts
explode in code size exponentially. Not that this really makes a lot of sense, but that's the **fun stuff** I do for
recreation. ðŸ˜…

All scripts output `Scalable Vector Graphics` (SVG) image files directly which easily can be loaded in common vector
graphics application like `InkScape`, `Affinity Designer`, `Adobe Illustrator`, and so on. A few of the scripts also can
output a custom `JSON`-based format of particle or shape descriptions which then can be further processed by related scripts or
imported into 3D graphic software packages like `Blender` or `CINEMA 4D` for rendering.

Comitl concentrically arranges randomly sized arcs into a pretty disc shape. Output is generated as a set of vector shapes in Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) format and printed on the standard output stream. Comitl also supports SVG animations, optional PNG output (with `cairosvg`), and has countless of parameters for configuration of the generated shape.
